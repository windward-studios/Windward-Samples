JSON Batch Processing with C#
========
This sample contains the files necessary to demonstrate batch processing with a JSON data source. The JSON file provided in the Data folder in the sample directory contains a list of records, with each entry corresponding to an order. The sample will parse this list of records, and create a request to process a simple Invoice template for each record. The completed documents will then be saved in the GeneratedDocs folder. 
In order for this sample to work, open the JsonBatchProcessing.sln file with Visual Studio, enter a valid Windward RESTful engine license (a trial license will work) in the JsonBatchProcessing.cs file, and run it.
