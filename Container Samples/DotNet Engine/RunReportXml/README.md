Containerizing a Custom .NET Engine Solution with Docker
========
This sample contains the files necessary for creating a custom implementation of the Windward .NET engine inside a Docker Container. This sample creates an image that will run the included sample template Windward Trucking 2 - Template.docx to generate the Report.pdf file as output. The guide that walks through this process is located [here](https://ohana.windwardstudios.com/m/79483/l/1500578-containerizing-a-custom-net-engine-solution-with-docker).
